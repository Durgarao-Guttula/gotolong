10. Ideal Value (Intrinsic Value of the company)

   10.1 check history of share price (3 year and 5 year) and compare it IV value
   
   10.2 Intrinsic Value
   
   I.V = EPS * (8.5 + 2 * EPS growth)
   
   Any share at a price of 2/3 of IV valus is great (provides decent margin of safety)
   +25% : bull
   +/-10% : correction (price adjustment)
   -25% : bear
   
   10.3 Graham Number

The formula is as follows:
The Graham Number = Square Root of [ (22.5) x (EPS) x (Book Value per Share) ]

The 22.5 is included in the formula as a rule of thumb to account for Graham's assumption that the price-to-earnings ratio should not be over 15 and the price to book ratio should not be over 1.5 for an undervalued stock. So, the number is generated as: (P/E of 15) x (P/B of 1.5) = 22.5.

Theoretically, any stock trading below its Graham Number is considered undervalued.


11. Brand recall

Brand figures continuously in top 20 (Good recall) : Great	
Brand figures continuously in top 50 (Ideal)
Brand figures continuously in top 100 (Good recall)	 
Investor is not familiar with brand	General public and investor are not familiar with the brand (Very bad)

12. Dividend

Parameter	Great	Ideal	Good	Bad	Very Bad
Dividend Payout Ratio	> 30%	20 % (approx)	> 10 %	< 10 %	0 %
Dividend yield 	> 4% is briiliant (more than 3.5% interest in regular savings account)	

Top Dividend yield of BSE 500 and BSE 200 stocks.

13. PEG vs PE
PEG also and not just PE : Check PEG (Price to Earnings to Growth) Ratio:  (P/E/G : Growth rate) in case companies have similar growth.
PEG should not be used to compare a high growth company with another low growth (and good dividend paying company).
It can be used when both are high growth companies etc.

PEG Ratio	< 1 (steal, under-valued)
PEG ratio 1 (Ideal)
PEG ratio > 1 (Bad)
PEG ratio > 2 (over-valued)

14. Price to Book ratio

PB ratio (Price to Book value Ratio) : It is used in some industries which have assets with them like banks and housing finance companies
where assets (liquid etc) on the book are more important.  It should be closer ro 1 (fair value of assets). For technology companies
like softare industry, it doesn't matter much and it can be 10 times also.

For asset heavy companies : NBFC, banks and finance companies like housing finance etc
Price to Book Value	< 1 (under-valued, steal)
Price to Book Value	 1 (ideal)
Price to Book Value	 > 1 (bad)
Price to Book Value	> 2	 (over-valued)

18. Enterprise Value 
    Enterprise Value = market capitalization plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents
                     = mcap + debt - cash
                     
    EV < Mcap : More Cash (Good)
    EV > Mcap : More Debt (Bad)
   
    18.1 EV - MCAP - Debt + Cash > 0
              Company has cash & cash equivalents > debt (GOOD)
    18.2 EV - MCAP - Debt + Cash < 0
              Company has debt > cash & cash equivalents (OK)
